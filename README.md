# Netflix Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior for a subscription-based OTT platform and builds predictive models to identify high-risk customers.

## 🛠 Tools Used
•⁠  ⁠SQL (MySQL)
•⁠  ⁠Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
•⁠  ⁠Logistic Regression
•⁠  ⁠Random Forest

## 📊 SQL Analysis Insights
•⁠  ⁠Overall churn rate: ~50%
•⁠  ⁠Basic subscription users showed highest churn
•⁠  ⁠Inactive users (15+ days) had significantly higher churn
•⁠  ⁠Gift Card & Crypto payment methods showed higher churn risk

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Logistic Regression
•⁠  ⁠Accuracy: 89.6%
•⁠  ⁠Recall (Churn class): 92%

### Random Forest
•⁠  ⁠Accuracy: 97.3%
•⁠  ⁠Precision & Recall (Churn class): 97%

## 🔍 Key Drivers of Churn
•⁠  ⁠Payment Method (Gift Card, Crypto)
•⁠  ⁠User inactivity (last_login_days)
•⁠  ⁠Subscription type
•⁠  ⁠Device type

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
•⁠  ⁠Target inactive users with retention campaigns
•⁠  ⁠Offer incentives for unstable payment methods
•⁠  ⁠Improve engagement for low watch-hour users
